Dataset below contains images taken using a smartphone used in the following paper https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336011001_Deep_Learning_for_Smartphone-based_Malaria_Parasite_Detection_in_Thick_Blood_Smears.

All pictures contain malaria parasites. The positions of the parasites have been documented. Good if we want to use a U-net model.
