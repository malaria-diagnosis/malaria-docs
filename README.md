###  Target Product Profile for a mobile app to read rapid diagnostic tests to strengthen infectious disease surveillance  
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6988927/
It is agreed that such a Rapid Diagnostic Test app:
- should be compatible with many Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) and mobile devices without needing accessories
- assist the user with RDT-specific instructions, include checks to facilitate quality control of the testing process
- suggest results with â‰¥ 95% accuracy across common lighting conditions while allowing the user to determine the final result
- data from the app must be under the control of the health program that operates it
- app should support at least one of the common data exchange formats HL7, FHIR, ASTM or JSON
- this document also lays out the minimum data security and privacy requirements for the app

### Smartphone Dataset
Dataset below contains images taken using a smartphone used in the following paper https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336011001_Deep_Learning_for_Smartphone-based_Malaria_Parasite_Detection_in_Thick_Blood_Smears.

All pictures contain malaria parasites. The positions of the parasites have been documented. Good if we want to use a U-net model.
