## Background 

*see presentation for full details https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GJHvZOue72l2UZTkG139Mc0QleS45RrM/view


### malaria DIAGNOSTIC challenges 

- Presumptive diagnostic
- Microscopy thick smear
- Rapid Diagnostic Test

* Acknowledging, the limitations of each method, local best practice is to use all three methods.

* existing diagnostics process:
The Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT)
(for full explanation for the RDT proplems see presentation on Google docs -link above)

### treatment 
Three days of Artemisinin treatment. 
Artemisinin is the most effective anti-malarial drug. Artemisinin resistant parasites have been found in Cambodia.


### project challenges 

- should we aim for | new independent medical device| or | using an existing infrastructure/equipment (smartphone) and aim to improve the diagnostic process 
- not medically nor technically well trained personal (Light health training funded by international donors)
- personal usually over worked and as a result often misdiagnos 
- budget: for general adoption throughout south Sahara African countries must be   


### product / service key features 

- microscop / mobile phone app 
- Ai powered 
- multiple use (instaid of current solusion which are single use only) 
- Quick diagnostic
- Efficiency


### possible storage options
- raspberry pi
- cloud (conditional on internet infrastructure)
