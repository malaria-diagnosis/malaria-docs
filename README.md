###  Target Product Profile for a mobile app to read rapid diagnostic tests to strengthen infectious disease surveillance  
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6988927/
It is agreed that such a Rapid Diagnostic Test app:
- should be compatible with many Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) and mobile devices without needing accessories
- assist the user with RDT-specific instructions, include checks to facilitate quality control of the testing process
- suggest results with â‰¥ 95% accuracy across common lighting conditions while allowing the user to determine the final result
- data from the app must be under the control of the health program that operates it
- app should support at least one of the common data exchange formats HL7, FHIR, ASTM or JSON
- this document also lays out the minimum data security and privacy requirements for the app

### Smartphone Dataset
Dataset below contains images taken using a smartphone used in the following paper https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336011001_Deep_Learning_for_Smartphone-based_Malaria_Parasite_Detection_in_Thick_Blood_Smears.

All pictures contain malaria parasites. The positions of the parasites have been documented. Good if we want to use a U-net model.

- Title: Whole slide imaging system using deep learning-based automated focusing, URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6968754/ Problem: auto focusing system, which involves moving a microscope stage along a vertical axis to find an optimal focus position, is the chief component of an automated digital microscope. Current automated focusing algorithms, especially those deployed in cost effective microscopy systems, often cannot match the efficiency of a skilled human operator in keeping a sample in focus Solution: auto focusing system that utilises the recent advances in machine learning, namely deep convolutional neural networks (CNN); (We describe the practical implementation of this method on a low cost digital microscope)
